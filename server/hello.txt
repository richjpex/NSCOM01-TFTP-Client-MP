No, the provided server code does not specifically handle duplicate ACKs. 
It follows the basic flow of the TFTP protocol, where the server sends data packets 
and waits for the corresponding ACK packet from the client. 
If a timeout occurs while waiting for an ACK, the server assumes that the 
previous data packet or ACK was lost and retransmits the corresponding packet.

However, the code does not implement any explicit handling of duplicate
ACKs, which may occur due to network issues or other factors. Duplicate 
ACKs can lead to retransmission of the same data packet unnecessarily, 
potentially causing inefficiency in the data transfer process.

To handle duplicate ACKs, you can modify the server code to keep track 
of the last acknowledged block number. If the server receives a duplicate 
ACK for a block that has already been acknowledged, it can choose to either
 ignore the duplicate ACK or retransmit the next data packet. The appropriate 
 handling of duplicate ACKs may depend on the specific requirements and behavior
 desired for your TFTP server implementation.
