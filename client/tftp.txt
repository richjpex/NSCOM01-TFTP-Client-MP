The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a UDP-based application 
layer protocol that is used to perform a simple file upload or 
download within a LAN setting. At present, it is commonly used to transfer 
network appliance operating system images and configuration files to and 
from a computer for backup or update purposes. Since it is UDP-based, 
the TFTP specification includes mechanisms that allow applications to 
perform simplified reliable and ordered data delivery that would have 
otherwise been unavailable from the transport layer. The majority of TFTP 
applications conform to TFTP version2 , which has its specifications 
documented in RFC 1350 and later extended with additional features using RFCs 2347, 2348 and 2349.

For this project, you will be programming a TFTP client program 
that complies with these protocol specifications
